Hereâ€™s a short description for your Email Spam Classifier project:

Email Spam Classifier using NLP and Machine Learning

This project involves the creation of a spam classifier for emails/SMS using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled messages, where the goal is to distinguish between "spam" and "non-spam" messages.

Key features of the project:

Text Preprocessing: The text data is cleaned by converting to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying stemming.
Vectorization: The processed text is transformed into a numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Model Training: A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) is trained on the vectorized data.
Web Application: The model is deployed as a web app using Streamlit, where users can input a message to classify it as either "Spam" or "Not Spam."
The project demonstrates the power of NLP and machine learning in detecting spam content efficiently.
